# Tasks: Comprehensive Project Audit

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-project-audit/`
**Prerequisites**: [plan.md](./plan.md), [spec.md](./spec.md), [research.md](./research.md), [data-model.md](./data-model.md), [contracts/audit-report.schema.md](./contracts/audit-report.schema.md), [quickstart.md](./quickstart.md)
**Tests**: No product test implementation requested. Verification tasks use local build/runtime/browser/API checks and record evidence.
**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by independently verifiable audit stories.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel because it touches a different source area or report section.
- **[Story]**: Maps to the audit story being delivered.
- Every task includes the concrete file path to inspect, update, or record into.

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Audit Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Prepare the audit report artifact and confirm active scope.

- [x] T001 Confirm `.specify/feature.json` points to `specs/001-project-audit` and record active feature path in `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/specs/001-project-audit/audit-report.md`
- [x] T002 Create the required report skeleton from `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/specs/001-project-audit/contracts/audit-report.schema.md` in `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/specs/001-project-audit/audit-report.md`
- [x] T003 Add report metadata, scope, assumptions, redaction rules, and blocked-check policy from `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/specs/001-project-audit/quickstart.md` to `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/specs/001-project-audit/audit-report.md`
- [x] T004 Verify current Git state with `git -C /Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction status --short --branch` and record any Git blocker in `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/specs/001-project-audit/audit-report.md`

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Build the complete source, configuration, command, and safety inventory that all audit stories depend on.

**CRITICAL**: No user story review should begin until this inventory exists.

- [x] T005 Inventory root scripts, workspace declarations, dependencies, and package versions from `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/package.json` into `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/specs/001-project-audit/audit-report.md`
- [x] T006 Record whether dependencies are already installed via `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/node_modules/` and `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/package-lock.json`, or whether `npm install` is required before verification, in `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/specs/001-project-audit/audit-report.md`
- [x] T007 Document whether a lint command exists in `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/package.json`, `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/apps/dashboard/package.json`, and `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/apps/api/package.json`, run it only if present, and record the result or absence in `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/specs/001-project-audit/audit-report.md`
- [x] T008 [P] Inventory public website routes, pages, and entry points from `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/src/router.tsx`, `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/src/App.tsx`, and `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/src/pages/` into `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/specs/001-project-audit/audit-report.md`
- [x] T009 [P] Inventory public website API usage from `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/src/lib/apiClient.ts` and `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/src/hooks/` into `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/specs/001-project-audit/audit-report.md`
- [x] T010 [P] Inventory dashboard routes, pages, and admin workflows from `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/apps/dashboard/src/App.tsx` and `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/apps/dashboard/src/pages/` into `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/specs/001-project-audit/audit-report.md`

- [x] T013 [P] Inventory API models and data entities from `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/apps/api/src/models/` into `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/specs/001-project-audit/audit-report.md`
- [x] T014 [P] Inventory deployment and build configuration from `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/vite.config.ts`, `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/apps/dashboard/vite.config.ts`, `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/vercel.json`, and `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/.vercelignore` into `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/specs/001-project-audit/audit-report.md`
- [x] T015 Record sensitive/runtime artifact locations from `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/.env`, `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/apps/dashboard/.env`, `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/apps/api/.env`, and `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/apps/api/.mongodb-data/` without copying values into `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/specs/001-project-audit/audit-report.md`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies.
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion and blocks all user stories.
- **US1 Verified Surface Coverage**: Depends on Foundational inventory.
- **US2 Runtime and Integration Verification**: Depends on Foundational inventory; API runtime task T031 is blocked unless T030 proves a safe local runtime.
- **US3 Code Quality and Maintainability Review**: Depends on Foundational inventory.
- **US4 Performance, SEO, UX, and Accessibility Review**: Depends on Foundational inventory and benefits from US2 build outputs.
- **US5 Security and Configuration Review**: Depends on Foundational inventory.
- **US6 Prioritized Final Report**: Depends on US1 through US5.
- **Polish**: Depends on US6 draft completion.

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1)**: MVP coverage story; complete first after Phase 2.
- **US2 (P1)**: Can run after Phase 2; runtime tasks T031-T033 depend on build outcomes T022-T025, and T031 also depends on safe-runtime gate T030.
- **US5 (P1)**: Can run after Phase 2; dependency audit T053 may be blocked by network access.
- **US3 (P2)**: Can run after Phase 2 independently.
- **US4 (P2)**: Can run after Phase 2; T046 depends on build artifacts from T023/T024 if they exist.
- **US6 (P1 finalization)**: Requires findings from US1-US5.

### Parallel Opportunities

- T008-T014 can run in parallel after T005-T007.
- T016-T020 can run in parallel within US1.
- T024-T025 can run in parallel after T022.
- T028-T029 can run in parallel within US2.
- T034-T037 can run in parallel within US3.
- T039-T045 can run in parallel within US4.
- T047-T052 can run in parallel within US5.
- T061-T064 can run in parallel during final polish.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First

1. Complete Phase 1 and Phase 2.
2. Complete Phase 3 (US1) to produce a full surface inventory and initial report skeleton.
3. Stop and validate that every discoverable surface is represented before deeper findings are added.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Add US2 to confirm runtime/integration defects, using T030 as the required API safety gate before starting API services.
2. Add US5 to capture security/configuration risks early.
3. Add US3 and US4 for maintainability and user-facing quality.
4. Add US6 to prioritize all findings into a stakeholder-ready report.
5. Run final polish checks before using the report for remediation planning.

### Execution Notes

- Keep all report evidence in `/Users/mohamedeidali/Desktop/fortune-construction/specs/001-project-audit/audit-report.md`.
- Do not paste `.env` values, tokens, credentials, database records, or uploaded file content.
- Do not start `npm run dev:api` unless T030 confirms that production or sensitive database usage can be ruled out.
- Stop any dev server started for browser/API verification.
- Record browser console errors and failed network requests during runtime verification.
- Mark blocked checks explicitly instead of guessing.
- Treat source changes and actual fixes as a later remediation phase, not part of this task list.
